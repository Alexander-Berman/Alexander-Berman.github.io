Through case descriptions, we contribute an understanding of how children can become or fail to become individuals literate in Making within a formal learning context. Our analysis draws from video recordings and other data sources of two 4th grade classrooms in which the students, who had already participated in 1.5 years of more structured ‘makified activities’, engaged in an open-ended, exploration-based, and playful task that was more in line with the spirit of Making. Student teams were classified as ‘high in Making literacy’ and ‘low in Making literacy’, revealing how Making literacy was expressed at the level of skills, mental models, and practices in various ways for different students. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates what burgeoning Making literacy may mean in a public elementary school classroom, paving the way for a vision of a time when Making becomes generalized practice.","tags":["Making","Self-Efficacy"],"title":"Becoming Makers - Examining Making Literacy in the Elementary School Science Classroom","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Osazuwa Okundaye","Malini Natarajarathinam","Matthew Kuttolamadom","Alexander Berman","Sharon Chu","Francis Quek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558542233,"objectID":"138117ee9430dbeb0e59be8cb69c2549","permalink":"/publication/asee/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/asee/","section":"publication","summary":"The purpose of this paper is to focus on how the “Making as Micro-Manufacture (M2)” model, can elucidate STEM learning and self-efficacy outcomes in high-school students through the development of communities of practice in the classroom. We focus on a dual-tiered curriculum for motivating STEM participation and self-efficacy in high school students. Here, we will detail how a dual-class curriculum was designed, established, and implemented alongside STEM learning and self-efficacy outcomes for students. The M2 model focuses on how high-variability, low volume-products may be produced in real-world settings and for the real-life purpose. We use the M2 model as a motivating scenario in the form of practice-based learning course where high-school students produce instructional, hands-on science kits for a partnered elementary school of the same community. The program has two cohorts of students in the classroom, one of which has prior experience in engaging in the M2 model and its application in the production pipeline for instructional science kits. In our second year of the program, we investigated how these two cohorts interacted with each other in the classroom. ‘Junior’ members, who are of the incoming class, are provided a survey of knowledge and skills necessary to engage in the M2 model. ‘Senior’ members, who previously participated in the program one year prior, are charged with a focus on the managerial aspects of the production, delegating process-oriented roles,’ and acting as peer-mentors for ‘Juniors’. Participants of the program were supported via a combined team of distance mentoring, training workshops by a Tier I University’s engineering technology graduate students and professors, and on-site high school and elementary school teachers. The participating population are situated in a rural, underserved border community consisting of populations typically underrepresented in STEM. The evaluation was performed through the joint use of questionnaires, interviews, and video recordings of daily class sessions. Collectively, our results demonstrate how a community of practice is developed among the two-class cohorts, holding implications for the potential for STEM learning and self-efficacy outcomes as students are given personal charge of classroom outcomes.","tags":["Community of Practice","Self-Efficacy","Making"],"title":"Developing Communities of Practice through Peer Mentorship in Making through Micro-manufacturing Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Berman","Elizabeth Deuermeyer","Beth Nam","Sharon Chu","Francis Quek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558542233,"objectID":"a7b8ea385f9c2cecd68b34f451ee4ad1","permalink":"/publication/exploring3d/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/exploring3d/","section":"publication","summary":"With increasing focus on integrating 3D printing in educational settings, more emphasis needs to be placed onhow to introduce young students to the complexities of the 3D printing process.

To understand how virtual online resources may support inherently physical Making activity, we investigate the landscape of Maker websites for children through a perceptionbased study and a content analysis study. Our findings showed that Maker websites for children are of 3 types -- associated with a fixed space, a transient space, or without any physical presence. These provide different support structures for learning and Maker mindset development.

In rural areas, the need for experienced mentors is often exacerbated by distance of experienced Maker-mentors from the classroom.

A study was conducted with 22 participants comparing 3D-printed objects made of two materials (SLA resin and PLA) with mass-manufactured plastic objects. Qualitative and quantitative results revealed that people perceive material differences in texture, shine and quality, and that they interpret 3D-printed and mass-manufactured objects differently.
